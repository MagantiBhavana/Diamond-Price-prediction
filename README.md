# Diamond-Price-prediction
💎 Diamond Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on various features using a supervised machine learning approach. It utilizes the popular Diamond Dataset (from seaborn or Kaggle) and applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression models to forecast diamond prices accurately.

📌 Features Considered:
Carat

Cut (quality)

Color

Clarity

Depth

Table

Dimensions (x, y, z)

🛠️ Key Steps:
Data cleaning and feature transformation

One-hot encoding of categorical features

Correlation and EDA using seaborn/matplotlib

Model training using Linear Regression and other regression models

Model evaluation with metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R² score

📈 Goal:
Build a model that can accurately estimate the price of diamonds to assist jewelers, buyers, or sellers in understanding value based on physical characteristics.
